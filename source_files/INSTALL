FIRESTARTER:

run ./FIRESTARTER

run 'make' to rebuild from source

$CUDA FIRESTARTER_CUDA:
$CUDA 
$CUDA dependencies:
$CUDA - nvidia-cuda >=5.0
$CUDA - gcc >=4.4
$CUDA 
$CUDA run ./FIRESTARTER_CUDA
$CUDA 
$CUDA By default, this tool is linked with nvidia-cuda/8.0
$CUDA If you have another version you need to recompile: `make clean; make cuda`
$CUDA Be sure to have the correct LINUX_CUDA_PATH in the Makefile.
$CUDA 
$CUDA Troubleshooting:
$CUDA - older GPUs without support for double precision only work with the -f or 
$CUDA   --usegpufloat switch
$CUDA - if there appears an 'API mismatch' error, check for correct nvidia-drivers
$CUDA   and kernel modules installation
$CUDA - if GPU Initialization takes too much time (like 15-30 seconds), make sure
$CUDA   that persistence mode is enabled (use: nvidia-smi --persistence-mode=1)
$CUDA #end if
$CUDA
